# filter

This Program takes a bitmap image as input and then the user can either apply the Blur filter, Sepia filter, Grayscale filter or Reflection Filter. Then the output released will be an image with the user's choice of filter applied.

Instructions:
- Run the filter.c program
- Upload the original image at the images folder
- The result will be an image named out.bmp
- The command to execute the program would look something like this in the shell: $ ./filter -g images/yard.bmp out.bmp
